Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.<br>

• Type 1<br> diabetes is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin.<br>
<br>
• Type 2<br> diabetes affects how your body uses sugar for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.<br>
<br>

• Needing to urinate more often than usual<br>
<br>

Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves.<br>
