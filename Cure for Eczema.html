Ayurvedic Treatments for Eczema<br>
<br>
Ayurvedic treatment for eczema will usually start by determining whether the skin condition is Vata, Pitta or Kapha dominant. While any of the dosha can be dominant, Pitta is almost always a factor in eczema as it governs the liver, blood and digestion – all of which affect the texture and health of the skin.

Once the root imbalances have been determined, an Ayurvedic practitioner will determine a treatment path, including healthy food and lifestyle changes to support ‘Brahmacharya’: energy management. In Ayurveda, Brahmacharya is the third pillar of life. The word derives from ‘Brahma’, meaning God, and ‘Charya’, meaning conduct. In that way, Brahmacharya means ‘conduct motivated by the search for God’. In other words, Brahmacharya is about staying connected with ourselves and our environment to make the best choices for our entire being.<br>

Ayurvedic practitioners often recommend that you avoid spicy, oily, sour, fried and fatty foods, including red meat, coffee and alcohol, and instead eat a plant-rich diet, choosing a cooling and astringent food and drink to pacify Pitta. For severe itching (suggesting Kapha involvement), a practitioner may also suggest reducing sugar and dairy. Vegetables from the nightshade family, such as tomatoes and aubergine, can also contribute to inflammation.<br>
<br>
People with eczema need to stay hydrated, consuming plenty of water alongside liquorice tea and aloe vera juice.
<br>
Nutrients including zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and essential fatty acids can help to ease symptoms, along with herbs including cardamom, turmeric, Triphala, neem and Indian sarsaparilla. Tea tree oil and neem oil can also help to relieve itching and reduce redness, while aloe vera gel and coconut oil can soothe dry lesions.<br>
<br>
Alongside these dietary changes, an Ayurvedic doctor might suggest other lifestyle adjustments, such as daily exercise, meditation and breathing exercises to relax the nervous system, avoiding daytime naps, and maintaining good personal hygiene. To avoid further irritating the skin, gently dry after washing using tapping movements and wear loose clothes made of natural fabrics. Some practitioners recommend consuming ghee butter daily to reduce toxins and soothe skin problems.<br>
