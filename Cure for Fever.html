">Ayurveda recommends various natural remedies for fever, but it's essential to consult a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner for personalized guidance. Here's a general remedy:

1. Tulsi (Holy Basil): Tulsi leaves have anti-pyretic properties. Boil fresh tulsi leaves in water, and drink the decoction to reduce fever.<br>

2. Ginger and Honey: Mix ginger juice and honey in equal proportions. Consume this mixture to reduce fever and boost your immune system.<br>

3. Coriander Tea: Boil coriander seeds in water and drink the decoction. Coriander has cooling properties and can help reduce fever.<br>

4. Fenugreek Seeds: Soak fenugreek seeds in water overnight and drink the water in the morning. Fenugreek can help lower body temperature.<br>

5. Coconut Water: Coconut water is a natural electrolyte and can help with hydration during fever.<br>

6. Rest and Hydration: Getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated is essential to help the body recover from fever.<br>

Remember that Ayurvedic remedies should be used in conjunction with conventional medical care when necessary. If your fever persists or worsens, consult a healthcareÂ professional.<br>
