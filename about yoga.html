<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 1.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
 
Pose type: Standing <br>

Downward Facing Dog goes hand in hand with yoga, but just because you've heard of this pose doesn't mean it's easy to do.<br>

Beginners often lean too far forward in this 

posture, making it more like a plank. Instead, remember to keep your weight mostly in your legs and reach your hips high, with your heels stretching toward the floor (they do not need to touch the floor).<br>

Bend your knees a little to facilitate the move if you have tight hamstrings. Keep feet parallel.<br>

Benifits of Adho mukha svanasana:<br> Adho mukha svanasana is a forward bending type of position.<br>It may help 
stretch the muscles of the legs, hands, calves and inner thighs.<br> This is a rejuvenating pose.<br> PharmEasy It 
might help strengthen the muscles and improve the blood supply to the brain.<br>

2.Vrksasana<br>

<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 2.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
Pose type: Standing/Balancing <br>

Tree pose is an excellent introduction to balancing postures.<br> If you feel yourself beginning to topple, you can step out of it easily.<br> Try not to create a counterbalance by jutting your hip to the side of your standing leg.<br>

Focus your gaze on a spot on the floor, and try varying foot positions to see what.<br>

works for you:<br> Heel resting low on the ankle, on a block, or above or below the knee.

Benifits of Vrksasana:<br> Vrksasana calms and relaxes the central nervous system and strengthens the legs and 
opens the hips and improves your neuromuscular coordination and endurance. It may thus be helpful for 
those who suffer from sciatica (nerve pain in the leg).<br>

3.Trikonasana<br>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 3.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
 
Pose type: Standing<br>

The Triangle can be modified like Extended Side Angle, using a yoga block for your bottom hand if you aren't comfortable reaching your arm to the floor. <br>You can 

also rest your hand higher up on your leg—on your shin or thigh—but avoid putting it directly on your knee.<br>

Don't hesitate to micro-bend both knees if the pose feels uncomfortable. This won't look or feel like a pronounced bend, but rather, just enough of a movement to unlock your knees and ease tension in your hamstrings.

Benifits of Trikonasana:<br> 'Tri' means three and 'Kona' means 'corner'.<br> So, trikonasana literally translates to 'Three
corners'.<br> It is named so as the final posture resembles a triangle formed by the torso, upper limbs and 
lower limbs.<br> Trikonasana mainly focuses on stretching the body sideways.<br> It may help improve spinal 
flexibility.<br>

4.Virbhadrasana<br>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 4.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
 
Pose type: Standing<br>

The critical thing to remember in Warrior I is that the hips face forward.<br> Think of your hip points as headlights—they should be roughly parallel with the front of your mat.<br> This may require you to take a wider stance.<br>

Benifits of Virabhadrasana:<br> Virabhadrasana may help in strengthening the arms, shoulders, and thighs.<br> It may 
also help in relieving sciatica and maintaining the balance of the Easy body.<br> It may also help singers by 
opening the chest and enabling them to sing long phrases in one breath.<br>

5.Tadasana<br>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 5.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
 
Pose type: Standing<br>

Mountain pose may not be as famous as Downward Facing Dog, but it is equally important.<br> This is an excellent time to talk about alignment, which is how your body parts are ideally arranged in each pose.<br>

The alignment in Mountain pose draws a straight line from the crown of your head

to your heels, with the shoulders and pelvis stacked along the line. Every person's body is different, so focus on rooting down with your feet and lengthening up with your spine.<br>

A yoga teacher can talk you through this in class, reminding you to slide your shoulders down your back and keep weight on your heels.<br>

Benifits of Tadasana:<br> Tadasana centers your body and mind, which helps create a calm sense of inner peace.<br> 
Maintaining alignment and body awareness is a constant process.<br> Standing strong, steady, and centered 
in Mountain Pose helps to improve posture, alignment, and balance.<br> This can benefit other yoga poses 
as well as your daily movements.<br>

6.Savasana<br>

<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 6.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>

Pose type: Resting<br>

Most yoga sessions end lying flat on your back in Corpse pose.<br> It's a critical transition between the end of your yoga practice and the rest of your day. <br>Bringing the body to stillness challenges the mind to maintain its calm.<br> You may find this difficult at first, but it gets easier with practice.<br>

Benifits of Savasana:<br> Savasana is the most relaxing pose, usually performed at the end of the yoga 
session.<br> It acts a cool-down posture.<br> It is basically meditation in the supine position, which 
allows us to be aware of our inner self while our body is physically at rest.<br>

7.Balasana<br>

<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 7.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>

Pose type: Resting<br>

Child's pose is essential because it's the position you assume whenever you need a break during a yoga class.<br> If you ever feel fatigued, you don't have to wait for the teacher to call for a break.<br>

Just move into Child's pose and rejoin the class when you're ready.<br> It provides a gentle stretch for the back, hips, thighs, and ankles, but does not challenge strength or balance.

Taking Child's pose is really up to your discretion, which happens to introduce one of yoga's best lessons:<br> Being attuned to the signals your body is giving and respecting them above any external directions.<br>

Benifits of Balasana:<br> Balasana or resting pose has therapeutic benefits for anxiety, stress, depression, sleeping 
difficulties and fatigue.<br> This asana may activate the limbic system which helps the body respond to 
intense emotions such as fear and anger by activating the fight or flight response. <br>

8.Paschimottanasana<br>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 8.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
 
Pose type: Seated<br>

There are many hamstrings stretches in beginning yoga for a good reason.<br> The hamstrings tend to get short and tight in people who sit a lot, which can contribute to low back pain.<br> Stretching them, as you do during the seated forward bend, is helpful.<br>


This pose offers a stretch to the entire back of the body. Bend at your hips, not your waist, and keep your neck aligned with your spine.

Benifits of Paschimottanasana:<br> Paschimottanasana is a seated forward bend yoga.<br> In this Yogasana, the entire 
back of the body from head to heels, including the spinal column, is deeply stretched.<br> This benefits spine 
mobility and overall flexibility.<br> It adds to the calmness of the mind and Pharm reduces anxiety. <br>


9.Bandhasana<br>
<div style="text-align:center;margin-right: 20px;"><img src="c:\Users\manth\OneDrive\Desktop\Herbelworts\website's items\yoga 9.jpg" width="250" height="250"></div>
 
Pose type: Backbend<br>

Bridge pose is a gentle way to explore spine extension, also known as a 

backbend.<br> It's a good idea to start incorporating this type of movement because it improves the mobility of your spine and counters the effects of too much sitting.<br>

If Bridge seems too intense, try a supported bridge with a block.<br> Remember to root into the feet, which helps you use your leg muscles to support the pose.<br>

Benifits of Bandhasana:<br> The muscle of the back of the neck, hip, flexor muscles and thighs are stretched while 
performing setu bandhasana.<br> Thus, it may help in strengthening these muscles.<br> It might also help 
strengthen the muscles of the buttocks.<br> In addition, it is also believed to be good for strengthening weak 
and tired legs.<br>

To come out of the pose, bend your knees and use your core to slowly draw your legs down to the ground.<br> After an inversion, take a few moments to readjust before returning to your practice.<br>
