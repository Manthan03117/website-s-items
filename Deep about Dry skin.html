<body>
Dry skin makes the skin look and feel rough, itchy, flaky or scaly. The location where these dry patches form vary from person to person. It's a common condition that affects people of all ages.

Dry skin, also known as xerosis or xeroderma, has many causes, including cold or dry weather, sun damage, harsh soaps, and overbathing.

You can do a lot on your own to improve dry skin, including moisturizing and practicing sun protection year-round. Try various products and skin care routines to find an approach that works for you.<br>

Symptoms<br>
<br>
Dry skin is often temporary or seasonal — you might get it only in winter, for example — or you might need to treat it long term. Signs and symptoms of dry skin might vary based on your age, health status, skin tone, living environment and sun exposure. They include:

A feeling of skin tightness
Skin that feels and looks rough<br>
<br>
Itchiness (pruritus)<br>
<br>
Slight to severe flaking skin, which causes the ashy look that can affect dry brown and black skin<br>
<br>
Slight to severe scaling or peeling<br>
<br>
Cracked "dry riverbed" look to leg<br>
<br>
Fine lines or cracks<br>
<br>
Skin that ranges from reddish on white skin to grayish on brown and black skin<br>
<br>
Deep cracks that may bleed<br>
<br> 

Causes<br>
<br>
Dry skin is due to water loss from the outer layer of skin. It might be caused by:<br>
<br>

Heat. Central heating, wood-burning stoves, space heaters and fireplaces all reduce humidity.<br>
<br>
Environment. Living in cold, windy conditions or low-humidity climates.<br>
Too much bathing or scrubbing. Taking long, hot showers or baths or scrubbing your skin too much can dry your skin. Bathing more than once a day can remove the natural oils from your skin too.<br>
<br>
Harsh soaps and detergents. Many popular soaps, detergents and shampoos strip moisture from your skin because they are formulated to remove oil.<br>
<br>
Other skin conditions. People with skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) or psoriasis are more likely to have dry skin.<br>
<br>
Medical treatments. Some people develop dry, thick skin after undergoing treatment for cancer, receiving dialysis or taking certain medications.<br>
<br>
Aging. As people age, the skin thins and produces less of the oils needed for the skin to retain water.<br>
