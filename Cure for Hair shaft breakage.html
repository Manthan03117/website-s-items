According to Ayurveda, when your Tridoshas or life energies are not in harmony, the normal functions of your body are disrupted. Healthy hair is an expression of a balanced Ayurvedic Dosha which refers to glossy, beautiful and strong hair as compared to when it is limp and frizzy. Having said that, medical conditions like Iron deficiency, Hypothyroidism and Biotin Deficiency can also lead to hair damage and split ends.

Ayurvedic remedies for split ends can help revive the hair’s health, along with strengthening and nourishing the hair follicle in a way that helps get rid of split ends. Let’s have a look at some split ends treatment at home.<br>
<br>
Diet For The Dosha<br>
A big part of any Ayurvedic treatment or remedy is diet. It is very important that you pay close attention to your diet if you want to get rid of split ends in your hair. You should include foods like Spinach, Eggs, Curry Leaves, Milk and Amla in your diet. These foods not only act as a split ends remedy but also help maintain a healthy lifestyle. Along with that, regular warm oil massages or Shiro Abhyanga with Ayurveda-recommended oils can reduce the dryness of hair and calm the Vata dosha, and keep the hair nourished, which eventually prevents split ends.
