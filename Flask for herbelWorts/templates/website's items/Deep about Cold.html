The common cold is an illness affecting your nose and throat. Most often, it's harmless, but it might not feel that way. Germs called viruses cause a common cold.<br>

Often, adults may have two or three colds each year. Infants and young children may have colds more often.<br>

Most people recover from a common cold in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. Most often, you don't need medical care for a common cold. If symptoms don't get better or if they get worse, see your health care provider.<br>

Illnesses of the nose and throat caused by germs are called upper respiratory tract infections.<br>

Symptoms<br>
Most often, common cold symptoms start 1 to 3 days after someone is exposed to a cold virus. Symptoms vary. They can include:<br>

Runny or stuffy nose.<br>
Sore or scratchy throat.<br>
Cough.<br>
Sneezing.<br>
Generally feeling unwell.<br>
Slight body aches or a mild headache.<br>
Low-grade fever.<br>
The mucus from your nose may start out clear and become thicker and yellow or green. This change is normal. Most often, it doesn't mean that you have a bacterial illness.<br>


Symptoms that get worse or do not get better.<br>
Fever greater than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius) that lasts more than three days.<br>
Fever returning after a fever-free period.<br>
Shortness of breath.<br>
Wheezing.<br>
Intense sore throat, headache or sinus pain.<br>
For children. Most children with a common cold don't need to see a health care provider. Get medical care right away if your child has any of the following:<br>

Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in newborns up to 12 weeks.<br>
Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any age.<br><br>
More-intense symptoms, such as headache, throat pain or cough.<br>
Trouble with breathing or wheezing.
Ear pain.<br>
Fussiness or drowsiness that isn't typical.<br>
No interest in eating.<br>

Causes<br>
Many viruses can cause a common cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.<br>

A cold virus enters the body through the mouth, eyes or nose. The virus can spread by:<br>

Droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.<br><br>
Hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold.
Sharing objects with the virus on them, such as dishes, towels, toys or telephones.<br>
Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.<br>
Risk factors<br>
These factors can increase the chances of getting a cold:<br>

Age. Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.<br>
Weakened immune system. Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.<br>
Time of year. Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winte<br>r.
Smoking. Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.<br><br>
Exposure. Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.
