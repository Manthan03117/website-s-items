<body>
Alopecia areata is a common autoimmune disorder that often results in unpredictable hair loss.<br>
<br>
In most cases, hair falls out in small patches around the size of a quarter. There may be only a few patches, but alopecia areata can affect wider areas of the scalp.<br>
<br>
If there is a complete loss of hair on the scalp, doctors diagnose alopecia totalis. If there is hair loss throughout the entire body, the condition is called alopecia universalis.<br>
<br>
Symptoms:<br> 
<br>
The most prominent symptom of alopecia areata is patchy hair loss. Coin-sized patches of hair begin to fall out, mainly from the scalp.<br>
<br>
There may be itching or burning in the area before hair loss. The hair follicles are not destroyed and so hair can re-grow if the inflammation of the follicles subsides. <br>
<br>
Alopecia areata can also affect the fingernails and toenails, and sometimes these changes are the first sign that the condition is developing.<br>
<br><br>
There are a number of small changes that can occur to nails:
<br><br>
• Pinpoint dents appear<br>
<br>
• White spots and lines appear<br>
<br>
• Nails become rough<br>
<br>
• Nails lose their shine<br>
<br>
• Nails become thin and split<br>
<br>
Cause:<br>
<br>
The condition occurs when white blood cells attack the cells in hair follicles, causing them to shrink and dramatically slow down hair production. It is unknown precisely what causes the body’s immune 
system to target hair follicles in this way.<br>
<br>
Other research has found that many people with a family history of alopecia areata also have a personal or family history of other autoimmune disorders, such as atopy, a disorder characterized by a tendency to be hyperallergic, thyroiditis, and vitiligo.<br>
