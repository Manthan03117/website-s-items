If you are looking for an Ayurvedic treatment for your skin, here are the ten solutions that you should definitely try out. Of course, you can choose two or more of the following treatment options.
<br>
<br>

It offers the hormones gibberellins and auxin to the skin to reduce inflammation and promote healing. Massaging Aloe Vera gel on the skin can help to get rid of the redness and irritation that comes with skin dryness. If you donâ€™t have an Aloe Vera plant online, you can order Aloe juice or gel online.

<br>
#2 Apply Kumkumadi Taila on the skin<br>
<br>
Kumkumadi oil or Kumkumadi Tailam is an important Ayurvedic solution for dry skin. It is a blend of different essential oils and herbs, though saffron is one of the main ingredients. kumkumadi oil can work as a moisturizer, cleanser, and toner for someone with dry skin. A bit of oil massage all over the skin on a daily basis can be really helpful.

<br>
#3 Ashwagandha to use internally and externally<br>
<br>

Curcumin, an active ingredient found in turmeric, can treat different skin conditions, which includes roughness and dryness.

<br>
<br>
#5 A bit of lemon juice and honey for the rescue<br>
<br>
It is a misconception that pimples are only for oily skin. Excessive skin dryness can also lead to pimples and fine lines. This is where honey comes into the picture because the antibacterial properties present in it can inhibit more than sixty different types of bacteria. You can mix a little bit of lemon juice with a teaspoon of honey and apply this mixture on your face. 
<br>

#6 Get your daily dose of Amla for dry skin<br>
