What is Hair Breakage?<br>
You can expect to lose about 100 hair strands daily if you are healthy. If your hair's natural growth cycle does what it is supposed to, new ones should grow to replace the hair strands you lost. When you start to have more loss of hair strands than grow back, you have hair loss.

Hair Breakage Causes<br> 
There are several general causes of hair loss and hair breakage, including:<br>
<br>
Brushing wet hair<br>
<br>
Styling products with long-lasting hold<br>
<br>
Tightly pulled hairstyles <br>
<br>
Perming, relaxing, or coloring hair<br>
<br>
Lack of healthy nutritional levels<br>
<br>
Overly brushing or styling your hair<br>
<br>
Not using conditioner<br>
<br>
One of the more common causes of hair breakage is acquired trichorrhexis nodosa. It is more common in those of African heritage and is directly affected by hair grooming and styling practices and proper cleansing product use, as suggested by scientists. Risk factors for this relating to reasons the hair shaft breaks include thermal styling tools. Think blow dryers and flat irons. Also, hair perming and permanent dye. These all damage the outer layer of the shaft of the hair, which is the protective cuticle. A damaged cuticle can alter the protein structure of the hair. This causes the fiber to be exposed, leading to weakness and breakage.

Hair Breakage Symptoms<br>
Hair loss is different for everyone. Common symptoms of hair breakage and loss, depending on what is causing it, could include:<br>
<br>
Breakage along the shaft<br>
<br>
Split ends<br>
<br>
Dry hair<br>
<br>
Frizzy, rough texture<br>
<br>
If you have African heritage, your hair may be more curly or tightly coiled. This increases your risk factor for having hair damage and loss from trichorrhexis nodosa. This is due to the difference in structures in the hair shaft. The hair fibers are asymmetric in shape and curvature. This makes the hair weak in certain areas of the shaft. It is also harder to keep curly hair hydrated, and dry hair breaks easier. With trichorrhexis nodosa, hair can break at the center shaft with minimal grooming. The hair may be uneven, with areas of shorter hair on the scalp. You may see white nodes on the hair, which are near split ends. Breakage may occur at the level of the hair where it was previously processed, and new hair has grown out. It may seem as if your hair is not getting longer, and the scalp is often irritated.
